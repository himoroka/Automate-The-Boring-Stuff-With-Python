# Automate-The-Boring-Stuff-With-Python

As a Python beginner, I wanna improve myself by uploading the coding tasks in the book I am reading now.
Maybe the code looks stupid or terrible sometimes, I believe I will become much better in the near future.
I will be very appreciate if these codes can give you some tiny help.

Thanks for your supporting!
